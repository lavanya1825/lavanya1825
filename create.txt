STEPS TO CREATE A PORTFOLIO WEBSITE:
Creating a simple portfolio website involves HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript. Below is a basic example of a portfolio website code structure. You can expand upon this based on your needs.

### Basic Portfolio Website Code

#### 1. HTML (index.html)
#### 2. CSS (styles.css)
#### 3. python flask(app.py)
### Instructions to Use the Code

1. **Create Files**: Create two files in a new folder: `index.html` and `styles.css`.
2. **Add Content**: Replace placeholder text and image paths with your actual content and images.
3. **Images**: Make sure to have images (like `project1.jpg`, `project2.jpg`, etc.) in the same folder or adjust the paths accordingly.
4. **Open in Browser**: Open `index.html` in a web browser to view your portfolio.
5. **Email Form**: The contact form uses `mailto:` to send emails. You can replace it with a server-side solution for better functionality.

### Next Steps
- **Enhance Design**: Customize the CSS to match your personal style.
- **Add More Projects**: Include more portfolio items as needed.
- **JavaScript**: Optionally, add JavaScript for interactivity (like form validation or animations).
- **Deploy**: Once satisfied, consider deploying your website using platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
